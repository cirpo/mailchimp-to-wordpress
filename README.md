# Mailchimp to Wordpress

A node script to parse a Mailchimp archive, extract part of its content and post it to a Wordpress website via REST API.

*__NOTICE__: this script is highly customised to work with the template for a newsletter called [Readings for Lunch](http://us1.campaign-archive2.com/home/?u=a7b66a940002c25ced3d7ae1f&id=260572c54b) so if you want to use it for your own newsletter you will have to adapt the parser according to your email template.*
